    <!--
    Dot indicators are a JavaScript-only replacement for the scrollbar.
    Typically, UX designers don't like scrollbars as they are ugly. Also, in
    this particular case, since we are dealing with a small and discrete number
    of items, navigating around them is quicker (for visual users) when using
    dots. Since the list itself can also be navigated using a keyboard, this
    control is redundant and does not need be accessible. We're using a
    non-semantic div that will not be announced by screen-readers nor accept
    keyboard navigation. It's strictly for JavaScript-enabled visual users with
    pointer devices.

    We could populate the entire subtree within the dot indicators div, but
    since it's a JavaScript only feature, we don't want to bloat the HTML too
    much. We create the children in JavaScript.
