# Vanilla JavaScript patterns

This repository contains examples of typical front-end UI patterns 
implemented using JavaScript with no libraries.

These examples do not include any SSR. For a general SSR pattern, see 
[this repository](https://github.com/foxbunny/vanilla-ssr).

## Running the examples

All examples are "run" by opening the `index.html` file located in the 
example folder. Alternatively, some editors and IDEs support previews which 
are effective for these examples. 

Development server can be used but not needed. If you wish to use one, the
project root contains an `index.html` file that links to the individual 
examples.

## Examples

Each example is a sub-folder within this repository. The following examples are 
available:

### `table-sorting-filtering`

An example of DOM-infused state to facilitate sorting and filtering of a table.
